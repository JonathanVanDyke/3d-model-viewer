                        <h1>Jonathan Van Dyke</h1>
                        <h4>Emerging Technologist</h4>
                        <p>Jonathan Van Dyke is the technologist of the core Emerging Technologies team. 
                            He has a background in engineering, research, and has been the technical lead on 
                            projects ranging from supercomputing to aircraft systems. New to the group, 
                            Jonathan does a deep dive into each new technology to learn what it can and can't do.
                            Currently the team is focusing on Extended reality, where Jonathan has made proof of 
                            concept applications with his VR and AR development skills.</p>
